# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts used for local development,
testing, and operational tasks.

## Guidelines
- Scripts should be simple and explicit
- Prefer shell scripts unless there is a strong reason otherwise
- Avoid hidden side effects
- Document required environment variables

## Examples
- setup.sh – local environment setup
- test.sh – run tests consistently
- lint.sh – code quality checks
- deploy.sh – deployment helpers (if applicable)
