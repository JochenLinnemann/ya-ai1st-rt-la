# AI Usage Guide

This directory defines how AI agents should assist with this repository.

AI is expected to:
- Ask clarifying questions when context is missing
- Respect existing architecture and decisions
- Propose minimal, incremental changes
- Explain tradeoffs clearly

AI must NOT:
- Introduce unnecessary abstractions
- Add dependencies without justification
- Assume unlimited infrastructure resources
