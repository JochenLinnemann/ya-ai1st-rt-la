# Retrospective Notes

This document captures observations, questions, and patterns noticed
during human–AI collaboration.

It is not a backlog or a decision log.
Notes here are discussed periodically and may or may not lead to action.

## Usage

This file captures observations about how humans and AI collaborate in this repository.

- Humans may add notes freely.
- AI should only add notes when explicitly asked to do so.
- Notes should be observational, tentative, and non-prescriptive.

Notes here are not decisions, tasks, or obligations.

## Examples

**YYYY-MM-DD**

- We drifted into refactoring before clarifying the goal.
- The AI kept optimizing edge cases; stopping earlier would have been fine.
- The prompt constraints worked well here.

**YYYY-MM-DD**

- This part of the system consistently causes confusion.
- The AI asked good clarifying questions once context.md was updated.
- We may be underestimating operational cost here.
